# Other regions

There are other regions that used the processing and part of the website code from this project show the cycling quality index for their city:

* [Vienna, Austria](https://bmaron.net/bla-cycling-quality/?mode=cqi&map=12.3/4.358/50.677)
* [Braine-l'Alleud, Belgium](https://vienna-cycling-quality.lw1.at/?mode=cqi&map=11/16.37/48.2)
* [Neuss, Germany](https://ckrey.de/neuss-cycling-quality/?mode=cqi&map=11.5/6.699/51.191)

Please [an issue or pull request on Github](https://github.com/osmberlin/www.osm-verkehrswende.org/issues) if you want to add your region to this page.

## How to set up the data and website

Right now, we do not have the technical setup and capacity to setup or support other regions ourself. The initial project team – Alex and Tobias – published some priorities in [the "next steps" blogpost](/cqi/posts/2024-03-23-next).

However, this is all open source and open for collaboration:

* [The Vienna CQI Repo on Github](https://github.com/Findus23/vienna-cycling-quality) is a great extract of the core functionality of this project as a stand alone website. It can be forked to create your own stand alone map ob the project.
* You will have to create your own dataset for you region [based on Alex' QGIS script](https://github.com/SupaplexOSM/OSM-Cycling-Quality-Index) using Overpass and QGIS+Python. This will create a .geojson with custom attributes.
* Afterwards you need to transform this geojson to pmtiles ([this is Tobias' script](https://github.com/osmberlin/www.osm-verkehrswende.org/tree/main/scripts/cqi/createPmtiles)). The [vienna project has a readme on this process](https://github.com/Findus23/vienna-cycling-quality/tree/main/data). The pmtiles need to be hosted somehwere and linked in the code.
* You can use github pages to host the website but the pmtiles is likely to large for Github, so you need some FTP- or S3-Space.

FYI, there is [talk about how to make this project multi-regional](https://github.com/Findus23/vienna-cycling-quality/issues/2).
