We just launched this project with [Alex' presentation at FOSSGIS 2024](/cqi/posts/2024-01-01-cqi-fossgis-2024) on the 23rd of april. Understandably there where questions about which next steps are planned for this project.

## Next steps

### Routing

We want to add a simple routing tool to the page which allows to showcase the different routes a person needs to take to bike from A to B based on one of the 4 leveles of traffis stess. Bike ottawa has this feature and it is a great way to tell the story of missing links in route network. My [presentation at Bits & Bäume 2022 has a few screenshots](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qs99tKNtUpjwgFZm-bfvWZdgcFv40ZCDvpOyheag3H4/edit#slide=id.gff2be6f386_0_127) that show what I mean.

Our plan is…

1. Continue the experiment with Dustins Route Snapper library which is unter the "Routing (Alpha)" page.
2. Reach out to outher routing services that use OSM data see if a cooperation is possible

### All of Germany

Our plan is, to migrate the proof of concept pythong script that Alex developed to the osm2pgsql powered processing of Radverkehrsatlas. This will give us updated data at least once a day for all of Germany.

There are a few things that need to happen…
- Compare the infrastructure categories from the python with that of the atlas-code; add what is needed in a way that works for atlas.
- Move the formular and settings from Python to Lua.
- Add the required geometric processing that the proof of concept needs to atlas

### My Country / The World

We don't have any plant ATM to get this project going on a wold level or other countries. But the code is open source, so you can always set this up for yourself. Please keep in mind that the configuration that we used to create the index'es will likely need adjusting for your specific cycling infrastructure. Also, you will likely need to do quite a bit of mapping in your region to get the high level of details into the OSM data that is needed for this project to produce meaningfull results.
